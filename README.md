DigiForm is an AI-assisted digital form-filling solution developed to address the significant challenges faced in Indiaâ€™s form-filling processes. These challenges include low literacy and digital literacy rates, limited access to internet and user-friendly platforms, language barriers, and complex documentation requirements. Modeled after the successful DigiLocker initiative, DigiForm aims to simplify and standardize digital form processing, enhance data accuracy, and improve service delivery through the use of AI.

Our solution operates on core design principles: speed, to ensure quick and user-friendly form filling; accuracy, with validation checks to reduce errors; privacy, with compliance to data protection regulations; and access, by providing multilingual support and inclusive user interfaces. DigiForm particularly benefits individuals with low to moderate literacy levels, those who find form filling tedious or challenging, and people requiring assistance due to disabilities.

By utilizing various information formats such as text, speech, and images, DigiForm minimizes the need for extensive text input, creating a more inclusive and rapid form-filling experience. Through AI, we strive to make form filling more accessible, efficient, and reliable for everyone, ultimately improving access to essential services in India.
